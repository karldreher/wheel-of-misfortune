            <p>Wheel of Misfortune is a game that aims to build confidence to oncall engineers via simulated
                outage scenarios.
                With the game, you practice problem debugging under stress, the understanding of the incident
                management protocol, and effective communication with other engineers
                of your team and organization. It is a great way to train new hires, interns, and seasoned
                engineers to become well-rounded oncall engineers.</p>
            <h4>Terminology</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scenario</strong>: A past or fictional incident case.</li>
                <li><strong>Game Master</strong>: The host-coordinator of the session.</li>
                <li><strong>Volunteer</strong>: The trainee oncall engineer.</li>
            </ul>
                Insert your incident scenarios into the general_incidents.json
                file inside the incidents
                folder. The file has the following format:
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>title</b></td>
                    <td>the title of the incident.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>scenario</b></td>
                    <td>the description of the incident. It is useful to include URLs from monitoring
                        systems, dashboards, time-series databases and playbooks.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>ID</b></td>
                    <td>the unique ID of the outage (you can just auto-increment).</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>inkstory</b></td>
                    <td>the path to an <a href="https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/">Ink</a> story file in JSON format.
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>You could use general_incidents.jsonnet
                as an example in case you want to generate your incident scenarios using <a
                    href="https://jsonnet.org/">Jsonnet.</a>
            <p>Wheel of Misfortune also supports the <a href="https://github.com/inkle/ink">Ink</a> scripting language
                for writing incident response narratives, for team and invdividual training. <a
                    href="https://github.com/inkle/ink">Ink</a> is a scripting language for writing interactive
                narrative stories. It enables us to write interactive incident response narratives for
                team or individual trainings. You can use <a href="https://github.com/inkle/inky">Inky</a> to write an
                interactive narrative for an
                incident and then export the story as JSON. Then, you can store the story file inside the
                folder and associate the Ink story file with an Incident scenario using the <b>inkstory</b> key. 
                You can have a look at the incident
                    narrative example.</p>

            <h4>Game Master</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose a volunteer to be the primary oncall engineer in front of the group.</li>
                <li>Find a balance between volunteer's experience and incident's difficulty.</li>
                <li>Assist volunteer by answering questions that may arise in each theoretical action or
                    dashboard observation.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Engage with the rest of the team and ask for different ways to debug the problem
                        following the volunteer's explanation.</li>
                    <li>Team members may be made available over time for assistance in various topics.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>At the end, have a debrief on the learnings of the session.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Volunteer</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Spin the wheel and attempt to fix the theoretical outage scenario.</li>
                <li>Explain to the Game Master and the rest of the group what actions you would take (lookup
                    queries, checks in dashboards, etc.) to find the root causes, and eventually solve the
                    incident.</li>
                <li>Always keep an eye on the time, since it is simulated incident response scenario and not a
                    routine troubleshooting process. During a real incident you might have an SLA or SLO
                    breach and therefore you should take timing into account.</li>
                <li>Engage with the rest of the group. Keep them in the loop. Ask questions to different
                    members depending on their expertise.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Most importantly, <strong>have fun!</strong></p>
            <p>You can read a comprehensive example on how to conduct the exercise <a
